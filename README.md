## About
This is my personal website to showcase my projects and serve as an extension of my resume. I also like to experiment with things on here e.g. the Tic Tac Toe robot (try it out!).


## CI/CD
This site uses GitHub actions and a self-hosted runner to continously integrate and deploy to GitHub pages.
The runner executes a YAML file located at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.

Note: Start the runner by running `zsh run.sh` in the actions-runner directory.
