## About
This is my personal website to showcase my projects and serve as an extension of my resume. I also like to experiment with things on here e.g. the Tic Tac Toe robot (try it out!).


## CI/CD
This site uses GitHub actions and a self-hosted runner to continously integrate and deploy to GitHub pages. `zsh run.sh`
